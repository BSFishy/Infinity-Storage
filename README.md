Infinity Storage is a fork of Refined Storage, to bring back a couple of key features from AE2. The download is for the current snapshot version of Infinity Storage. If you want the current release, or beta version, you will need to wait for Infinity Storage to be put on Curse Forge, or check to see if it is on the releases.
